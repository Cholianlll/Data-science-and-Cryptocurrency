            <p class="text1">At the start of the crypto world, the cryptocurrency is derived from the web, and people like to discuss a series of numerical indicators, like the price of Bitcoin, the computing power, and even the number of blocks. Then, after several years of development, ideals of de-centralized crypto worlds spread around the world. With more people coming in, some derivatives of cryptocurrency have been invented, such as the defi, NFT, private chain (BSC), and other associated activities or platforms, like the airdrop sessions and formal exchange (Binance), and so on. Now people focus more on the derivatives of the bitcoin rather in the elementary technology of bitcoin.</p>

          <p class="text1">These interactive plots is a good way for people to understand what is crypto world.</p>
          <br>
          <p class="text1">For instance, by using this networking map, we can have a deep and complete view of what is “NFT”. Starting with the central word “Metaverse” which is just a company and it focused on making the “NFT” and selling it. Then, finding its linked words “airdrop”. “Airdrop” represents a series of activities that attract people to participate in sessions for increasing public interest. Next, the keywords “binance” and “BSC”. Binance is a cryptocurreny exchange, and “BSC” is its private chain for supporting a lot of airdrop activities. Finally, some keywords seem to be similar to “playtoearn”. In the fact, to attract more people to participate in the “NFT” activities, a lot of platforms implement a lot of interesting small games to keep participants.</p>
          <br>
          <p class="text1">In a summary, for professionals, these kinds of plots and ARM help dig out some hidden useful information. Besides that, for common people, these kinds of interactive plots are also good ways to help new people to know what happened in certain areas. </p>
