            Since 2009, the first decentralized cryptocurrency, bitcoin, was created by presumably pseudonymous developer Satoshi Nakamoto, “Crypto” related things have grown into a public-hitting topic. With a few years” explosion in this field, a lot of derived tokens have come out, such as “Ethereum”, “Litecoin”, and even “Dogecoin”. Counted by the exchange “Binance”, there are 1663 tokens publicly traded now. </p>

            <p class="answer">At the start of the crypto world, the cryptocurrency is derived from the web, and people like to discuss a series of numerical indicators, like the price of Bitcoin, the computing power, and even the number of blocks. </p>
            <br>
            <p class="answer">Then, after several years of development, ideals of de-centralized crypto worlds spread around the world. With more people coming in, some derivatives of cryptocurrency have been invented, such as the defi, NFT, private chain (BSC), and other associated activities or platforms, like the airdrop sessions and formal exchange (Binance), and so on. Now people focus more on the derivatives of the bitcoin rather in the elementary technology of bitcoin.</p>

          <p class="answer">The whole cryptocurrency market has been diversified into different sub-areas, at least including the "NFT", "Market Capflow", "BTC", "ETH". </p>
          <br>
          <p class="answer">Some keywords or important features are play, volume, net, and bitcoin, where they are all the keywords belonging to each topic. For example, the "play" represents the culture of "NFT", the "Net" represents the "ETH", "volum" is a high-frequency word in "Capflow" and "bitcoin" is naturally the "BTC".</p>
          <br>
          <p class="answer">The boundary between different topics becomes clear although they arose from the same starting. </p>

            <p class="answer">The pursuit of Bitcoin is more radical, and it is destined to be difficult to achieve at this stage, but the blockchain currency system has broad development prospects. </p>
            <br>
            <p class="answer">Therefore, Bitcoin is now more used as the value scale of the blockchain asset market. It is precisely because of its broad prospects that countless institutions and talents have joined the exploration of the future of the blockchain, and the use of digital currency is no longer limited to the transaction currency function similar to Bitcoin. Numerous digital currencies were born and developed rapidly.</p>
