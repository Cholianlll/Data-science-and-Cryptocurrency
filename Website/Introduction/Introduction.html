            <p class="text1">“Crypto” related things have grown into a public-hitting topic. With a few years' explosion in this area, the traditional crypto topic, concentrated in discussing market quotes and pure fanaticism, has derived into several different directions, including “NFT”, “Bitcoins”, “Ethereum”, “Defi”, “Metaverse” and so on. </p>
            <br>
            <p class="text1">The first task of this project is aimed to explore some insights hidden in the massive topic squares platform, such as the Twitter platform.  </p>
            <br>
            <p class="text1">The first and most important thing is to explore whether there are any gaps within this huge area, implying a trend from a single topic to diversified areas. Then, for every single sub-topic, what special theme is will be the second task. Finally, after building several successful models for detecting and exploring different topics, the final stage is aimed to build the auto-enlabeling system on each new tweet, classifying each tweet into the right sub-topic. </p>

            <br>
            <p class="text1">Firstly, since the market size has been enough large for some mechain learning techniques to be implemented on it, our work can be acted as a pioneer or a good example of guiding other people who are interested in this field. Secondly, there are lots of unknown questions or explanations on the future of this field. By trying to explain some abnormal phenomenon with professional data science knowledge, it may bring new insight and even bring the answer behind the market. </p>

Then, after several years of development, ideals of de-centralized crypto worlds spread around the world. With more people coming in, some derivatives of cryptocurrency have been invented, such as the defi, NFT, private chain (BSC), and other associated activities or platforms, like the airdrop sessions and formal exchange (Binance), and so on. Now people focus more on the derivatives of the bitcoin rather in the elementary technology of bitcoin.</p>
